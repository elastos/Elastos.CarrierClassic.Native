## Summary

Elastos Carrier is a decentralized and encrypted peer-to-peer (P2P) communication framework that routes network traffic between virtual machines and Decentralized Applications (DApps).

The authentication process of peer nodes utilizes the Elastos Decentralized ID (DID) sidechain.

## Build from source

**CMake** is used to build, test and package the Elastos Carrier project in an operating system as well as compiler-independent manner.

Certain knowledge of CMake is required.

At the time of this writing, The compilation of sources works on **macOS**, **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian etc.) and **Windows**, and provides the option to cross-compile for target systems of **iOS**, **Android** and **RaspberryPi**.

### Ubuntu

#### 1. Brief introduction

On Ubuntu / Debian / Linux, beside the compilation for the host itself, cross-compilation is possible for the following targets:

* Android with architectures of **armv7a**, **arm64** and simulators of **x86/x86_64** are supported.
* RaspberryPi with architecture **armv7l** only.

#### 2. Install Pre-Requirements

To generate Makefiles by using **configure** or **cmake** and manage dependencies of the Carrier project, certain packages must be installed on the host before compilation.

Run the following commands to install the prerequisite utilities:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -f build-essential autoconf automake autopoint libtool flex bison libncurses5-dev cmake
```

Download this repository using Git:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK
```

#### 3. Build to run on Host

To compile the project from source code for the target to run on Ubuntu / Debian / Linux, carry out the following steps:


Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the previously downloaded folder that contains the source code of the Carrier project.

```shell
$ cd YOUR-PATH/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK
```

Enter the 'build' folder.
```shell
$ cd build
```

Create a new folder with the target host name, then change directory.
```shell
$ mkdir linux
$ cd linux
```

Generate the Makefile in the current directory:<br/>
Note: Please see custom options below.
```shell
$ cmake ../..
```
***
Optional (Generate the Makefile): To be able to build a distribution with a specific build type **Debug/Release**, as well as with customized install location of distributions, run the following commands:
```shell
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=YOUR-INSTALL-PATH ../..
```
***

Build the program: <br/>
Note: If "make" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make" instead.
```shell
$ make
```



Install the program: <br/>
Note: If "make install" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make install" instead.
```shell
$ make install
```


Create distribution package: <br/>
Note: If "make dist" fails due to missing permissions, use "sudo make dist" instead.
```
$ make dist
```

***
**Run Elashell or Elatests**
Elashell is a fully functional, lightweight shell program that processes commands and returns the output to the terminal.
Through Elashell, users may connect to other carrier nodes and exchange messages.

Elatests is also a shell program, but with predefined commands, therefore no user interaction is necessary. The output for every command
is displayed in the terminal for a simple evaluation of test results.

To run elashell or elatests, first extract the distribution package created previously and enter the extracted folder.
Then, change directory to the 'bin' folder.
```shell
$ cd YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-PACKAGE-PATH/bin
```

Start Elashell:
```shell
$ ./elashell.sh
```

Or start Elatests:
```shell
$ ./elatests.sh
```

#### 4. Cross-compilation for Android Platform

Elastos Carrier cmake system supports to build cross-compilation for android platform on Linux, which must be armed with android NDK toolchainsï¼Œrequired with minimum API level **21**. We recommend to use **android-ndk-r16b** or higher version.

Once having android NDK installed, run the following commands to build android distributions with target **arm64** as an example:

```
$ cd YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT/build
$ mkdir android
$ cd android
$ cmake -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_NDK_HOME=YOUR-ANDROID-NDK-HOME -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cmake/AndroidToolchain.cmake ../..
$ make
$ make install
$ make dist
```
where option **ANDROID_ABI** should be one of the target architectures listed below:

* armeabi-v7a
* arm64-v8a
* x86
* x86_64

Beware, the default installation of distributions are internally designed to be **outputs** of current working directory.

#### 5. Cross-compilation for RaspberryPi

Elastos Carrier cmake system supports to build cross-compilation for RaspberryPi on Linux, which must be armed with RaspberryPi toolchains. To be noticed, currently, cross-compilation for RaspberryPi only be allowed on Linux.

As to toolchains, you are recommended to download it from the github address:

```
https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
```
Once having RaspberryPi toolchains installed, run the following commands to build target distributions:

```
$ cd YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT/build
$ mkdir rpi
$ cd rpi
$ cmake -DRPI_TOOLCHAIN_HOME=YOUR-RASPBERRYPI-TOOLCHAIN-HOME -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cmake/RPiToolchain.cmake ../..
$ make
$ make install
$ make dist
```
As same to cross-compilation for android, the default installation of distributions are internally located under **outputs** of your working directory.

### macOS

#### 1. Brief intrudcution

On macOS, besides from to make compilation for maocOS itself, we also support to make cross-compilation for the following targets:

* Android with architectures for **armv7a**, **arm64** and simulators of **x86/x86_64**, as same to capabilities on Linux.
* iOS platforms to run on **iPhone-arm64** and **iPhoneSimulator-x86_64**.


#### 2. Install Pre-Requirements

As same to the reqirement on Linux, the following auxilary packages related to **configure** and **cmake** must be installed on host before any compilation, either by installation through utility **homebrew** or by building from source:

```
autoconf automake libtool shtool pkg-config gettext cmake
```

Beware, **homebrew** has an issue with linking **gettext**. So if you have an issue with execution of **autopoint**, fix it by run:

```shell
$ brew link --force gettext
```

#### 3. Build to Run on macOS

Once having source tree on macOS, run the same commands as addressed on Linux for the chapter of **build to run on host**. No extra special commands are needed for compiplation on Mac other than on Linux.

#### 4. Cross-compilation for Android Platform.

Elastos Carrier cmake system also supports to build cross-compilation for android platform on macOS with android NDK toolchains of same requirement of minimum API level **21**.

As to cross-comiplation in practice, refer to the commands as described on Linux for the chapter of **cross-compilation for android platform**. Be aware again, no extra special commands is required on macOS other than on Linux.

#### 5. Cross-compilation for iOS Platform

Elastos Carrier cmake system supports to build cross-compilation for iOS platform on macOS shipping with Apple Xcode of the minum iOS verison **9.0** supported, on top of which, run the following commands to build distributions to run on iPhone as an example:

```
$ cd YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT/build
$ mkdir ios
$ cd ios
$ cmake -DIOS_PLATFORM=iphoneos -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cmake/iOSToolchain.cmake ../..
$ make
$ make install
$ make dist
```
where option **IOS_PLATFORM** should be one of the target platforms listed below:

* iphoneos
* iphonesimulator

As same to run on Linux, the default installtion of distributions would be located to **outputs** under working directory unless with customized path by feeding option **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**.

### Windows

#### 1. Brief intrudcution

On Windows, Elastos Carrier cmake system only supports to compile for targets to run on Windows itself, but with 32-bits and 64-bits both supported, and visual studio IDE is mandatorily required. We recommend to use Visaul Studio IDE community 2017.

To build target for 32-bits, you need to choose `x86 Native Tools Command Console` for sure to run building commands, otherwise, run commands in `x64 Native Tools Command Console`.

#### 2. Build

Once having source tree and settling with command console, run the following commands under directory of `YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT/build`:

```
$ cd YOUR-SOURCE-ROOT/build
$ mkdir win
$ cd win
$ cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=outputs ..\..
$ nmake
$ nmake install
$ nmake dist
```
## Test

After successfully finished building from the source code, change directory to `${YOUR-INSTALL-PATH}/bin`,  and run shell demo application, which is an interactive shell for Elastos Carrier tester or beginner.

```shell
$ cd YOUR-INSTALL-PATH/bin
$ ./elashell.sh
```

You are also recommended to run api-level test suites to check whether Carrier APIs function working or not.

```
$ cd YOUR-INSTALL-PATH/bin
$ ./elatests.sh
```

## Build API Docs

Currently, the API documentation can only be built on the **Linux** host. MacOS has a bug issue with python, which would cause build process failure.

### Ubuntu

#### 1. Install Pre-Requirements

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen python-sphinx graphviz
$ curl -L -o /tmp/get-pip.py https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python /tmp/get-pip.py
$ sudo pip install breathe
```

#### 2. Build

Run the command under the directory where runs your building commands:

```shell
$ cmake -DENABLE_DOCS=ON ../..
$ make
```

Then, you will find new directory **docs** generated, which contains all APIs documentations with **html** format.
